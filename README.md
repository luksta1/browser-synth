# Browser Synth App using React & Tone.js

<br />
#### Introduction

Browser Synth is an in-browser synthesizer app that implements the [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) library. You can view the app on [heroku](https://browsersynth.herokuapp.com/) or follow the build instructions for local use.

The idea behind the app is to allow users to create a 16 bar melody in three different synthesizer modes. The user can then playback the melody and change the bpm. A future goal is to allow users to save their melodies to a unique url which will also be saved to a database of melodies that users can pull up as a "library".
